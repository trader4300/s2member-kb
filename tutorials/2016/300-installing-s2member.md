This Knowledge Base Article covers installing both the free *s2Member Framework* and the *s2Member Pro Add-on*. The *s2Member Framework* is the free plugin available from the [WordPress.org Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/s2member/). *s2Member Pro* is an add-on to the *s2Member Framework* which adds features to the base plugin. You must have the *s2Member Framework* installed to use *s2Member Pro*.   

*This article is part of the [s2Member User's Guide](http://s2member.com/kb/kb-tag/s2member-users-guide/), a series of articles that cover the fundamentals of using s2Member.*

## Installing the s2Member Framework

The *s2Member Framework* can be installed straight from *WordPress.org*. From **WordPress Dashboard → Plugins → Add New**, type <kbd>s2Member</kbd> into the **Search box** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The *s2Member Framework* should be the first plugin displayed in the grid. Click **Install Now**.

The plugin will install. Once you see *Successfully installed the plugin s2Member Framework...*, click **Activate Plugin**. That's usually all there is to installing the *s2Member Framework*. 

If you have any problems installing the *Framework* through the *WordPress* plugin directory, you can install the *Framework* using FTP instead.

### Alternative Installation Method: Using FTP

- Download the *s2Member Framework* zip file from your account at *s2member.com*. 
- Extract the files from the zip file. Inside the top-level folder you've extracted, you'll find the `s2member` folder.
- Log in to your web server using FTP.
- Navigate to the plugins folder for your installation of *WordPress*. This is `/wp-content/plugins/` by default.
- Upload the `s2member` folder to your plugins folder.
- After the files have uploaded you should see the following new folders in your plugins folder:
    - `s2member`
    - `s2member-files`
    - `s2member-logs`

Go into your WordPress Dashboard: **WordPress Dashboard → Plugins**. You should see *s2Member Framework* listed as an inactive plugin. Click **Activate**.

## Installing the s2Member Pro Add-on

If you've already configured the *s2Member Framework*, you might be concerned about losing your settings when you install the *s2Member Pro Add-on*. There's no reason to be concerned, but *s2Member* features a setting to prevent losing your configuration when deactivating the plugin. 

Go to **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member → General Options → Plugin Deletion Safeguards**. Make sure this is set to the default of **Yes(safeguard all data/options)**. Then click the **Save All Changes** button at the bottom of the page. 

**Tip**: *It is a good idea to always leave this set to* **Yes** *unless you are absolutely sure you will no longer be using s2Member on a website.*

**Note**: *You must install the s2Member Framework before installing the s2Member Pro Add-on.*

- Download the *s2Member Pro Add-on* zip file from your account at *s2member.com*. 
- Extract the files from the zip file. Inside the top-level folder you've extracted, you'll find the `s2member-pro` folder.
- Log in to your web server using FTP. (You can use an application like [FileZilla](http://s2member.com/r/filezilla-quick-start-for-s2member/).)
- Navigate to the plugins folder for your installation of *WordPress*. This is `/wp-content/plugins/` by default.
- Upload the `s2member-pro` folder to your plugins folder.
- After the files have uploaded you should see the following new folders in your plugins folder:
    - `s2member`
    - `s2member-files`
    - `s2member-logs`
    - `s2member-pro`

To verify that you completed this step properly, please make sure that you have the following file path:

`/wp-content/plugins/s2member-pro/pro-module.php`

If instead, you have double `/s2member-pro/s2member-pro/` directories nested inside each other, please correct this before you continue. **In other words, if you unzipped the folder inside itself, this will cause problems.** You should have: `/wp-content/plugins/s2member-pro/pro-module.php`, along with several other files and subdirectories.

Go into your WordPress Dashboard, **WordPress Dashboard → Plugins**. You should see something like **s2Member Pro 160303** listed next to the version number in the plugin listing for the *s2Member Framework*.
