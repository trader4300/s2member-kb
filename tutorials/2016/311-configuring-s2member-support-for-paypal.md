This Knowledge Base Article covers configuring *s2Member* to work with *PayPal*. *s2Member* integrates with *[PayPal Payments Standard](http://www.s2member.com/paypal)* for businesses. You do not need a **PayPal Pro** account. You just need to upgrade your *Personal PayPal* account to a *Business* status. This upgrade is free. A *PayPal* account can be [upgraded](http://s2member.com/r/paypal-business-upgrade/) from a *Personal* account to a *Business* account by clicking the **Profile** link under your **My Account** tab, selecting **Personal Business Information**, and then clicking the **Upgrade Your Account** button. See this KB article for further details: [Supported PayPal Account Types](http://s2member.com/kb-article/supported-paypal-account-types/).

This article is part of the [s2Member User's Guide](http://s2member.com/kb/kb-tag/s2member-users-guide/), a series of articles that cover the fundamentals of using *s2Member.*

## PayPal Pro Integration
The *s2Member Pro Addon* enables **PayPal Pro-Forms**. **PayPal Pro-Forms** are implemented with WordPress shortcodes. **Pro-Forms** allow you to keep Customers on your site at all times, consolidating the **Registration** and **Checkout** steps into a single form.

If you want to take advantage of **PayPal Pro** integration, you need to supply your **PayPal Pro API Username**, **Password**, and **Signature**. You also need a *[PayPal Payments Pro](http://www.s2member.com/r/paypal/)* account. **PayPal Pro** accounts require a formal application, along with a monthly fee. 

Once you have a *PayPal Pro* account, access your [PayPal API Credentials](http://s2member.com/r/paypal-profile-api-access/). Log into your *PayPal Pro* account, and navigate to **Profile → API Access** (or **Profile → Request API Credentials**). From the available options, please choose **Request API Signature**.

## Recurring Billing
If you plan to use any of the *Subscription* options in the **s2Member Pro-Form Generators** for **PayPal Pro**, you will also need [Recurring Billing](http://s2member.com/r/paypal-pro-recurring-payments-faqs/) enabled for your **PayPal Pro** account. *PayPal's Recurring Billing* service for *Pro* accounts is required for all types of *Subscriptions*, whether you intend for them to be recurring or not. 

However, *Recurring Billing* is not necessary for *Buy Now* functionality. The drop-down menus in **s2Member Pro-Form Generators** have been labeled  *Subscription* and *Buy Now* to help you make this distinction. 

See **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro)  → PayPal Pro-Forms**. On these panels, you can see which options require the use of *PayPal's Recurring Billing Service*. *PayPal* charges you a monthly fee for their *Recurring Billing Service* in addition to the fee for *PayPal Pro*.

## PayPal Options
See **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options** 

### PayPal Account Details
See **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal Account Details**
**This section is REQUIRED (if using PayPal)**.

- **Your PayPal Merchant ID**: At *PayPal*, see: **Profile → Secure Merchant ID**
- **Your PayPal Email Address**: At *PayPal*, see: **Profile → Email Accounts**
- **Your PayPal API Username**: At *PayPal*, see: **Profile → API Access** (or **→ Request API Credentials**)
- **Your PayPal API Password**: At *PayPal*, see: **Profile → API Access** (or **→ Request API Credentials**)
- **Your PayPal API Signature**: At *PayPal*, see: **Profile → API Access** (or **→ Request API Credentials**)

![paypal-account-details2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15786468/d438cb36-298a-11e6-946c-4aaa918c93d4.jpg)

#### Recurring Profile Behavior
If your **PayPal Pro-Form** is configured to bill on a recurring basis (starting the day of sign-up with no trial period) this setting controls the way *s2Member* handles the first payment.

We recommend *Consolidate w/ Recurring Profile* because this keeps all charges associated with a particular Member organized in your *PayPal* account.

No matter which option you choose, a first **Payment** (when applicable) is always charged immediately. However, in cases where it is critical that a Member not gain access until the first payment processes completely, please choose **Real-Time/Direct Pay**. This tells *s2Member* to authorize and capture the first payment in real-time during checkout instead of consolidating it into the **Recurring Profile**.

#### Developer/Sandbox Testing?
Choose *No* or *Yes*, as appropriate.
**Note**: We’ve found that it is often easier to test connections with *PayPal* in live mode with a small purchase amount rather than using **Sandbox** mode.

#### Enable Button Encryption?
If button encryption is enabled, all of your **PayPal Button** shortcodes are encrypted, improving security against fraudulent transactions. For extra security, you should update your *PayPal* account at *PayPal* too. See: **My Profile → Website Payment Preferences**. You'll want to block all non-encrypted payments. 
**Note**: this will **not** work until you've supplied *s2Member* with your **PayPal Email Address** and your **API Username**, **Password**, and **Signature**.

### Payflow Account Details
See **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → Payflow Account Details**
**This section is REQUIRED (if using Payflow)**.

Newer *PayPal Pro* accounts (*PayPal Pro w/ Payflow Edition*) come with the **Payflow API** for *Recurring Billing Service*. If you have a newer *PayPal Pro* account and wish to integrate *PayPal's Recurring Billing Service* with **s2Member Pro-Forms**, you must fill in the details on this panel. 

Providing your **Payflow API Credentials** puts *s2Member's* recurring billing integration through **Pro-Forms** into *Payflow* mode. After you fill in the details on this panel (**WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → Payflow Account Details**), *s2Member* uses the **Payflow Edition API** instead of the older **PayPal Pro DPRP Service**.

#### Payflow API Credentials
Once you have a *PayPal Pro* account, you need your **Payflow API Credentials**. Log into your *PayPal* account and navigate to **Profile → API Access** (or **→ Request API Credentials**). From the available options, please choose **Payflow / API Access**. You need the **Username**, **Password**, **Partner**, and **Vendor**.

**Important Note:** Supplying **Payflow API Credentials** here does not mean you can bypass other areas of *s2Member's* configuration. You must still supply *s2Member* with all of your *PayPal* account details. You configure your *PayPal Pro (Payflow Edition)* account here, but you must still set up other *PayPal Account Details* too (**WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal Account Details**.)

See this KB article [PayPal Account Types](http://s2member.com/kb-article/supported-paypal-account-types/)

![payflow-account-details](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15786493/f6597a80-298a-11e6-8f99-de12d947007b.jpg)

At *PayPal* see **Profile → API Access** or **Profile → Request API Credentials → Payflow API Access** for the following data:
- **Your Payflow API Username**
- **Your Payflow API Password**
- **Your Payflow API Partner**
- **Your Payflow API Vendor**

### PayPal IPN Integration
See **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal IPN Integration**
**This section is REQUIRED (if using PayPal)**.

![paypal-ipn-integration](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15786516/12c13654-298b-11e6-8fe0-938d566cee3e.jpg)

Log into your *PayPal* account and navigate to **Account Profile → Instant Payment Notification Preferences**

You need your **IPN URL**. Copy and paste the URL listed in this *s2Member* configuration panel (**WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal IPN Integration**) to the box in your *PayPal* profile.

#### IPN w/Proxy Key (Optional, for 3rd-party integrations)
If you are using a 3rd-party application that needs to `POST` simulated IPN transactions to your *s2Member* installation, you can use this alternate **IPN URL**, which includes a **Proxy Key**. This encrypted **Proxy Key** validates incoming data received by *s2Member's* IPN processor. You can change `[proxy-gateway]` to whatever you like. The `[proxy-gateway]` value is required. It is stored in the WordPress database as the Customer's **Paid Subscr. Gateway**. Your `[proxy-gateway]` value also appears in *s2Member's* IPN log.

Any 3rd-party application that is sending IPN transactions to your *s2Member* installation must include the custom `POST` variable, and that variable must always start with your installation domain (i.e., `custom=example.com`). Also, the `item_number` variable must always match a format that *s2Member* recognizes. 

Generally speaking, the `item_number` should be 1, 2, 3, or 4, indicating a particular **s2Member Level #**. However, *s2Member* also uses some advanced formats in this field. Just to be sure, we suggest creating a **PayPal Button** with the **s2Member Button Generator** and then taking a look at the *Full Button Code* to see how *s2Member* expects `item_number` to be formatted. Other than these exceptions, all other `POST` variables should follow *PayPal*   standards. Please see [PayPal's IPN/PDT reference guide](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/ipn/integration-guide/IPNandPDTVariables/) for full documentation.

### PayPal PDT/Auto-Return Integration
See **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal PDT/Auto-Return Integration**
**This section is REQUIRED (if using PayPal)**.

![paypal-pdt-auto-return-integration](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15786532/26a6118a-298b-11e6-83a4-74c69205450e.jpg)

You need your **PayPal PDT Identity Token** (this is **REQUIRED**.) Log into your *PayPal Merchant Account* and navigate to this section **Account Profile → Website Payment Preferences**. Turn the **Auto-Return** feature *On*.

You need the **Auto-Return URL** which is listed on this *s2Member* configuration panel ( **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal PDT/Auto-Return Integration**). Copy and paste this URL to the form in your *PayPal Merchant Account*.

You must also enable **PDT (Payment Data Transfer)** by turning it *On*. *PayPal* generates an **Identity Token** which you should copy and paste into the **PayPal PDT Identity Token** field on this *s2Member* configuration panel (**WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal PDT/Auto-Return Integration**). Your **PDT Identity Token** appears under **Profile → Website Payment Preferences** in your *PayPal Merchant Account*.

**Tip**: In addition to the default *Auto-Return/PDT* configuration inside your *PayPal Merchant Account* the **Auto-Return URL** is also set on a per-transaction basis from within the **PayPal Button** shortcode that *s2Member* generates. In other words, if you have multiple sites operating on one *PayPal* account, that is OK. *s2Member* sets the **Auto-Return URL** dynamically for each transaction. The result is that the **Auto-Return URL** configured from within your *PayPal* account becomes the default which may be overwritten on a per-transaction basis by *s2Member*.

**PayPal Pro**: The tip above (for *PayPal Payments Standard*) is also true for **PayPal Pro** integration.

#### Auto-Return Page Template (optional customizations)
With *s2Member Pro* installed, you have the ability to customize your **Auto-Return Page Template**. If you are using *PayPal Standard* integration (**PayPal Buttons**) each of your Customers are returned to your site immediately after they complete checkout at *PayPal*. Your **Auto-Return Page** displays a message and instructions for the Customer.

*s2Member* may change the message and instructions dynamically based on the type of transaction that is taking place. We do not recommend that you attempt to modify the message and instructions presented dynamically by *s2Member*, but you can certainly control the *Header* and the overall appearance of *s2Member's* **Auto-Return Page Template**.

The quickest, easiest way to do this is to add some HTML code in the box on this *s2Member* configuration panel (**WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Options → PayPal PDT/Auto-Return Integration → Auto Return Page Template (optional customizations**). For instance, you might include an `<img>` tag with your logo.

The box on the **Auto Return Page Template (optional customizations)** panel allows you to customize the *Header* section of *s2Member's* default **Auto-Return Page Template**. Everything else, including the textual response and other important details that each Customer needs to know about, are already handled dynamically by *s2Member* based on the type of transaction that is taking place. 

All you need to do is customize the *Header* with your logo, and anything else you feel is important. Although this *Header* customization is optional, we recommend an `<img>` tag with a logo that is around 300px wide. After you click the **Save All Changes** button, you may click the hyperlink on the panel to preview your *Header*.

##### Build Your Own Auto-Return Page Template
It is also possible to build your own **Auto-Return Page Template**. To create your own **Auto-Return Page Template** please make a copy of *s2Member's* default template: `/wp-content/plugins/s2member/includes/templates/returns/default-template.php`. Place your copy of this default template inside your active WordPress theme directory, and name the file: `/paypal-return.php`. 

*s2Member* finds your **Auto-Return Page Template** in this location, and uses your template instead of the default. You'll find details inside *s2Member's* default template file. Once your custom template file is in place, you can click the link on this *s2Member* panel to preview your header.

It is also possible to bypass *s2Member's* **Auto-Return** system altogether. For details, please read more about the `success=""` shortcode attribute for **PayPal Buttons** generated by *s2Member* in [this KBA](http://s2member.com/kb-article/creating-a-registration-thank-you-page/). See also **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Buttons → Shortcode Attributes (Explained)**.

**Note**: you must still configure your *PayPal Merchant Account* for **Auto-Return/PDT** (as instructed above). Then, you may use the `success=""` attribute in your shortcode, when and if you need it. In other words, if you use the `success=""` attribute in your shortcode, the initial redirection back to *s2Member's* default **Auto-Return/PDT** handler must still occur. However, instead of displaying the **Auto-Return Template** to the Customer, s2Member redirects the Customer to the URL that you specified in the `success=””` attribute of your shortcode, allowing you to take complete control over what happens next.

If you are having problems with your `success=””` attribute, see this s2Member KBA: [Why is my Pro-Form not redirecting after success?](http://s2member.com/kb-article/why-is-my-pro-form-not-redirecting-after-success/)
