In this article, you will be introduced to *s2Member’s* shortcode generators for **Pro-Forms** and **Buttons**. *s2Member* generates Pro-Form shortcodes according to the payment gateway you are using. **Pro-Forms are an s2Member Pro Addon feature and are not available with the free s2Member Framework**. Pro-Forms are available for *Free Registration*, *PayPal Payments Pro*, *Stripe*, and *Authorize.net*. Buttons for *ClickBank* are also a **s2Member Pro Addon** feature. Buttons for *PayPal* are available with the free *s2Member Framework* and, of course, work with the **s2Member Pro Addon** as well.

The generation process is the same for all Pro-Forms and Buttons (except for some variations in data-entry requirements), but you need to generate each particular payment gateway’s Pro-Forms and Buttons using the panels found on the *s2Member* Pro-Forms configuration for that gateway. For simplicity’s sake, we are (mostly) using the PayPal Pro-Form generators found here **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Pro-Forms** in this article. Where differences between gateways exist, they are specified.

*This article is part of the [s2Member User's Guide](http://s2member.com/kb/kb-tag/s2member-users-guide/), a series of articles that cover the fundamentals of using s2Member.*

## PayPal Specifics: PayPal Pro Requirements

Pro-Forms do not require *PayPal Payments Pro* (see [Supported PayPal Account Types](http://s2member.com/kb-article/supported-paypal-account-types/)), however depending on your use-case, you may want to use the PayPal Payments Pro service.

### PayPal Payments Pro is NOT Required if...

- You use *Free Registration* Pro-Forms. 
- You use PayPal Express Checkout.
- You integrate with [Stripe](https://stripe.com&sa=D&ust=1470238793505000&usg=AFQjCNGZ359MUl4EsyW0gTaFm8P1KNdWWQ) instead. (*Stripe* has no monthly costs.) See this [KB article](https://s2member.com/kb-article/does-s2member-integrate-w-stripe-bitcoin/) for details.

### PayPal Payments Pro IS Required if...

- You want to accept on-site credit card payments via Pro-Forms and *PayPal*.
- You want to take full advantage of everything that Pro-Forms can do in conjunction with *PayPal* and to have all functions work as intended.

## Form Fields Common to Most Pro-Forms

Pro-Forms are generated using the configuration panels found on the Pro-Forms panels found under your particular payment gateway, for example, **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → PayPal Pro-Forms**. Fill in the fields on the generator form. Once you have filled in all the form fields, click the **Generate Form Code** button and then copy the generated shortcode to a **Post** or **Page** you created in *WordPress*.

**Note**: Most rows have multiple data-entry boxes. For convenience-sake, the text that begins the row is shown below, followed by the data-entry requirements in bullets below.
