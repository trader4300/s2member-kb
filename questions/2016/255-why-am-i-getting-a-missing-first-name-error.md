s2Member uses customizable templates to create Pro-Forms. When using a custom template for a Pro-Form, you need to be sure that the type of template you use matches the type of shortcode you use. Use paid templates for paid shortcodes and vice-versa.

Using a template file that was meant for a free registration form on a Pro-Form for paid subscriptions, or vice-versa, will lead to an unanticipated error in the program flow. One of the symptoms is a misleading error message: *Missing First Name*. You'll be scratching your head wondering how the first name could be missing when you just typed it in and hit "Submit". 

## Error: Missing First Name
To see this problem in action, create a test form using a paid registration shortcode with a free registration template.

The shortcode:

The form produced by this shortcode looks fine:

### The Infamous *Missing First Name* Error Message
Go to your form, enter some test data and hit the **Submit** button and you will see this error message:

## Free Registration Form Template(s)

Pro-Form templates for free registration will have the following naming convention: `[payment-gateway]-registration-form.php` For example, `paypal-registration-form.php`. 

## Paid Registration Form Template(s)

Pro-Form templates for paid registration will have the following naming convention: `[payment-gateway]-checkout-form.php` or `[payment-gateway]-sp-checkout-form.php`. For example, `paypal-checkout-form.php`.

## Recap: Template Type Must Match Shortcode Type

Bottom line, when customizing s2Member you must always choose your tools carefully. Write down what it is you hope to accomplish: 

>Custom registration form for level 1 members paying by PayPal. Form is customized with a message saying "Joining us is a great decision!"

Make sure you choose the right template file for the task at hand. You'll avoid a lot of head-scratching!
